# Hey There! ðŸ˜Š

**I'm Imad**, *a .NET Full Stack Developer.*

I have been coding since 2021. The first thing I coded was a game called **[Guess My Number](https://github.com/getimad/guess-my-number)** using **Vanila JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**.

A year later, I started getting into **C#**, because I enjoy making games using **Unity**.

Nowadays, Iâ€™m interested in web development, including back-end, front-end, and testing technologies. I love to solve problems, develop skills, learn new things, and figure out how they work.
