# Hey There! ðŸ˜Š

**I'm Imad**, *a .NET Full-Stack Developer.*

I have been coding since 2020. The first thing I coded was a game called **[Guess My Number](https://github.com/getimad/guess-my-number)** using **Vanila JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**.

A year later, I started getting into **C#**, My journey includes solving **300+ LeetCode problems**, which has honed my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

Today, I'm all about **ASP.NET Core** and **React**, using these powerful tools to create web applications that are both scalable and beautiful.

Check out my **[LeetCode profile](https://leetcode.com/getimad)**.
